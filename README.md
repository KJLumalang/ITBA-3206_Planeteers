# Project Title: Drivng Down Greenhouse Gas Emissions through Clean Energy

##### Introduction
Human activity has increased the amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere to levels not seen in hundreds of thousands of years over the last 150 years. The magnitude of this effect is enormous. Humans now have such a global impact that most geologists, ecologists, and natural historians believe we have entered a new geological epoch known as the Anthropocene. Globally, the top 2 primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions are electricity and heat (31%) and transportation (15%) (World Resources Institute, 2017). Electricity production generates the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions. The burning of fossil fuels, primarily coal and natural gas, provides a significant portion of our electricity. The transportation sector is the source of the second most greenhouse gas emissions. The burning of fossil fuels in our cars, trucks, ships, trains, and planes is the primary source of greenhouse gas emissions from transportation. Petroleum-based fuels account for over 90% of all transportation fuels, primarily gasoline and diesel (IPCC, 2007). According to a research by National Renewable Energy Laboratory, 1994, One promising alternative for greenhouse gas reductions is the deployment of renewable energy technologies (RETs). Another solution for the massive emissions are Electric Vehicles. Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and all-electric vehicles (EVs) typically produce lower tailpipe emissions than conventional vehicles do.

This study aims to provide solutions to the massive and increasing amount of greenhouse gas emissions by the means of data analysis. Data sets will be used to analyze and show the increasing amount of emissions and which or what are the sources of these emissions. 

##### Problem Statement
Greenhouse gas emissions have far-reaching environmental and health consequences. They contribute to respiratory problems due to smog and air pollution, and they affect climate change by trapping heat. Other implications of climate change produced by greenhouse gases include extreme weather, food supply shortages, and increasing wildfires. The weather patterns we've come to expect will alter; some species will go extinct, while others will disappear or grow. This study will address the problems stated above and will provide measures for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.


##### Significance of the proposed porject
This study aims to tackle the impacts of the massive greenhouse gas emissions. It will also aims to provide mitigation strategies for reducing the rapidly increasing greenhouse gas emissions. This research will benefit the following:

Community - The society will be educated by this research. They will know the disastrous impact of greenhouse gas emissions and what are the possible solutions for this. This could help to future developments of mitigation for the tackled issue.

Government â€“ This study will aid them in taking possible solutions/actions that the country might face if this problem is not solved. This study will help them to develop solutions while considering our environment. 

Students - The students will be enlightened on the issue such that it will give awareness on how will they face the said problem. This research might also motivate them for developing plans to assist this global problem. 

Future Researchers - As for the future researcher, they can benefit on the study as means as a guide, a tool and reference when conducting researches which has relevance to the study.

##### Methods

##### Expected output

##### Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the Project
The SDGs which this project aims to attain are Affordable and clean energy and Climate Action. These SDGs are further described as follows;

Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy - Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.

Goal 13: Climate action - Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
