# Project Title: Drivng Down Greenhouse Gas Emissions through Clean Energy

##### Introduction
Human activity has increased the amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere to levels not seen in hundreds of thousands of years over the last 150 years. The magnitude of this effect is enormous. Humans now have such a global impact that most geologists, ecologists, and natural historians believe we have entered a new geological epoch known as the Anthropocene. Globally, the top 2 primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions are electricity and heat (31%) and transportation (15%) (World Resources Institute, 2017). Electricity production generates the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions. The burning of fossil fuels, primarily coal and natural gas, provides a significant portion of our electricity. The transportation sector is the source of the second most greenhouse gas emissions. The burning of fossil fuels in our cars, trucks, ships, trains, and planes is the primary source of greenhouse gas emissions from transportation. Petroleum-based fuels account for over 90% of all transportation fuels, primarily gasoline and diesel (IPCC, 2007). According to a research by National Renewable Energy Laboratory, 1994, One promising alternative for greenhouse gas reductions is the deployment of renewable energy technologies (RETs). Another solution for the massive emissions are Electric Vehicles. Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and all-electric vehicles (EVs) typically produce lower tailpipe emissions than conventional vehicles do.

This study aims to provide solutions to the massive and increasing amount of greenhouse gas emissions by the means of data analysis. Data sets will be used to analyze and show the increasing amount of emissions and which or what are the sources of these emissions.
